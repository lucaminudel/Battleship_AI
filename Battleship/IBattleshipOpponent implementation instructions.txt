IBattleshipOpponent is the interface your algorithm must implement to play the battleship game.

* Properties Name and Version must return your algorithm name and version, that will be printed in the console when your algorithm will play.

* NewMatch() is called one time before the beginning of the 1000 games played against one opponent. MatchOver() is called after the 1000th game, the last game.
  Those 2 methods are there for statistical logging purpose during the development of the algorithm. They must be empty, or do nothing, during the real competition.

* NewGame() method is called before every game start, for any of the 1000 games. Note that the same instance of your class that implement IBattleshipOpponent  is 
  used to run all the 1000 games. This enable you to collect statistical information about your opponent. You can put your game initialization code in this method.
* GameWon() or GameLost() method is called after every game finish based on the game result.   


Attack methods
* GetShot() method is called every time is your turn to shot to opponent ships, must return the coordinates of your shot. It implement your attack strategy.
* ShotMiss() or ShotHit() or ShotHitAndSink() is called after GetShot() to communicate the result of your shot.


Defence methods
* PlaceShips() is called at every time a new game start. You must place all your ships in the grid. It implement your defence strategy.
  This method can be called multiple times, until all the ships are not placed outside the grid and are not overlapping.
  Time spent to call this method multiple times is subtracted from the overall time available for one game (4 seconds).

* OpponentShot() is called every time the opponent shot to your ships and tell you the coordinates of your opponent shot.
